# Output files

The top-level `index.html` links the report for each species/lineage group.
`summary.json` records analysed and skipped groups.

The `logs/` directory contains each external command and a JSON fingerprint of
its direct inputs. ChronoClade uses those fingerprints to decide whether a
completed stage can be reused.

## Context preparation

`prepare-context` writes the complete same-ST accession list, the balanced
candidate pool, SKA screening distances, the selected context manifest,
combined metadata and a JSON audit of the selection process. Keep these files
with the analysis. A different public context sample can change the apparent
placement of focal isolates.

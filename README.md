# ChronoClade

ChronoClade tests whether sampling dates contain enough information to estimate a
molecular clock in a bacterial lineage. It builds a whole-genome phylogeny,
accounts for recombination with ClonalFrameML, examines the root-to-tip
relationship, and runs a date-randomisation test. TreeTime estimates a dated
phylogeny only when the temporal-signal test passes.

Two analysis modes are available. `full` uses ClonalFrameML and can use either
the quick root-to-tip permutation screen or complete TreeTime refits. `fast`
uses a Parsnp-style PhiPack Profile screen followed by root-to-tip permutations;
it is triage and deliberately does not produce a dated tree or an epidemiological
interpretation.

The workflow is intended for longitudinal surveillance within a species and
lineage, such as an MLST sequence type. Public context genomes can be added to
help distinguish a sampled local lineage from separate introductions. The final
HTML report keeps the temporal analysis, clonal SNP distances, topology and
context together.

ChronoClade does not infer direct transmission. A dated tree estimates ancestral
times under a molecular-clock model; it does not identify who infected whom.

## Installation

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) installs ChronoClade and its native dependencies on
macOS or Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghruproject/chronoclade.git
cd chronoclade
pixi install
pixi run chronoclade preflight
```

Windows users can run the Pixi environment under WSL2.

## Basic use

ChronoClade reads a CSV containing one row per assembly. Samples are analysed
separately by `species` and `lineage`.

```csv
sample_id,assembly,collection_date,location,species,lineage,origin,is_reference,patient_id
KPN001,assemblies/KPN001.fasta,2023-03,KIMS,Klebsiella_pneumoniae,ST15,local,true,P001
KPN002,assemblies/KPN002.fasta,2024-01-17,KIMS,Klebsiella_pneumoniae,ST15,local,false,P002
KPN_REF,context/KPN_REF.fasta,2021,Philippines,Klebsiella_pneumoniae,ST15,context,false,
```

Check the metadata and planned analyses before running the workflow:

```bash
pixi run chronoclade validate metadata.csv
pixi run chronoclade run metadata.csv --dry-run
```

Run the analysis:

```bash
pixi run chronoclade run metadata.csv \
  --output chronoclade_results \
  --threads 8 \
  --lineage-jobs 2 \
  --randomisation-jobs 4 \
  --date-randomisations 100
```

For a quick screen:

```bash
pixi run chronoclade run metadata.csv --mode fast --date-randomisations 100
```

For the more demanding date-randomisation test, refitting the full TreeTime
model after every permutation:

```bash
pixi run chronoclade run metadata.csv \
  --mode full \
  --date-randomisation-method full-tree \
  --date-randomisations 100
```

After SKA mapping, ChronoClade checks whether any genome is an extreme
raw-distance outlier within its declared lineage. A failed check stops before
IQ-TREE and ClonalFrameML and records the per-genome evidence in
`lineage_coherence.tsv`; verify the accession and lineage assignment before
rerunning. A second check on the recombination-filtered alignment writes
`clonal_lineage_coherence.tsv` before temporal analysis.

Open `chronoclade_results/index.html` when the run completes. Each lineage has
its own report and a ZIP archive containing the figures, tables, trees and
machine-readable results used in that report.

## Public context genomes

ChronoClade includes a compact index of high-quality assemblies from the
AllTheBacteria 2025-05 release. The `prepare-context` command finds dated
same-ST candidates, balances the screening pool across place and time, downloads
assemblies with [atbfetcher](https://github.com/happykhan/atbfetcher), and retains
nearby genomes plus a stratified background.

```bash
pixi run chronoclade prepare-context focal_metadata.csv \
  --scheme ecoli_achtman_4 \
  --st 131 \
  --output context/ST131 \
  --candidate-pool 500 \
  --max-context 150 \
  --nearest-per-focal 3 \
  --threads 8

pixi run chronoclade run context/ST131/combined_metadata.csv \
  --context-manifest context/ST131/context_manifest.tsv \
  --output chronoclade_results
```

The downloaded set is a bounded sample of public genomes. ChronoClade records
the candidate pool, screening distances and final selection so that the limits
of the context search remain visible.

## Worked example

The repository contains a real-data analysis of 72 *Staphylococcus aureus*
ST239 genomes sampled between 1980 and 2012. The estimated clock rate was
1.693 x 10^-6 substitutions per site per year, the inferred root date was 1946,
and the date-randomisation p-value was 0.0099. These estimates agree closely
with the published analysis of the collection.

The [worked example](https://ghruproject.github.io/chronoclade/worked-example/)
shows the commands, root-to-tip plot, randomisation result, dated tree with node
intervals, clonal distances and the resulting public-health interpretation.

The repository also includes an
[accession-defined ST131-H30 validation](validation/komori2024_st131/README.md)
against the 96 C0/C1 chromosomes from Komori et al. (2024). It records the
identity audit, both lineage-coherence checks and the distinction between
detectable temporal signal and an imprecise TreeTime root date.

## Documentation

The [ChronoClade documentation](https://ghruproject.github.io/chronoclade/)
covers input preparation, temporal-signal testing, report interpretation and
the command-line interface.

To build it locally:

```bash
pixi run docs
```

## Methods and limitations

ChronoClade uses SKA2 for reference-ordered whole-genome alignment, IQ-TREE for
the starting maximum-likelihood phylogeny, ClonalFrameML to account for
recombination, and TreeTime for clock analysis and time scaling. The observed
root-to-tip fit is compared with fits obtained after permuting collection dates.
The default screen requires a positive clock rate and an empirical R²
permutation p-value of 0.05 or less. The optional full-tree test reruns the
complete TreeTime fit and applies the stricter CR2 rate-interval rule.

Root-to-tip regression is a diagnostic rather than a formal test. Population
structure, biased sampling, date uncertainty and residual recombination can all
affect molecular-clock estimates. ChronoClade retains the source tables and
figures so these assumptions can be reviewed.

See the [methods page](https://ghruproject.github.io/chronoclade/methods/) for
the full workflow and references.

## Development

```bash
pixi run lint
pixi run test
pixi run docs
```

ChronoClade is under active development. Validate results against epidemiology
and the underlying phylogenetic outputs before using them to guide an
investigation.
